A Type Language for Python
==========================

https://github.com/kennknowles/python-typelanguage

This module provides a type language for communicating about Python programs and values. Humans
communicating to other humans, humans communicating to the computer, and even the computer
communicating to humans (via type inference and run-time contract checking).

----------------

There are many projects that check contracts or types for Python in some way or
another, but they all focus on checking, not communicating. As such, they miss what
I like best about types.
